From backend server development in Python, NodeJs, and SQL, to frontend development with and without frameworks, or services are highly extensible.\n\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content management solutions (CMS) such as Shopify, Wordpresss, Wix, or Foursquare can be difficult to manage or require work that takes extra time. Further, hosting services, content delivery networks, or other online services can provide a hassle that is not necessary when only wanting to focus on content creation and a working website or delivery feed.\n\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can provide services that simplify the steps of maintaining any sort of online presence. From the above-mentioned services, to creating a custom server, or setting up a self-hosted CMS we can provide a service plan with recommendations and complete transparency on best practices and our plan of work.\n"},"whoWeAre":{"title":"Who We Are","date":"7/9/2022, 3:16:15 AM","author":{"name":"Elias Rangel"},"content":"\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a service provider focused on web development, management of digital resources, and content management solutions.

We strive to provide services that allow us to initiate positive experiences between digital presences and inclusive audiences.\n\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our work within the online disability community and locally has shown us that there are many disconnects between digital services and client interests. Development practices, technology stacks, or stubborn hosting services often provide complex systems to work with when managing an online presence. Even registering for API services, content management systems, or blogging platforms require additional work that results in overlooked perspectives in the creation of content.\n\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main purpose, why we do it, is to make your digital services simple because everyone deserves accessible data. Everyone deserves to manage their online image the way the want with the technology they desire.

There are standards, conventions, many resources for businesses to utilize when creating new products. Unfortunately, especially for many start ups or small businesses, the accessibility of these resources itself is an issue. We strive to increase the accessibility of the tools necessary to ensure that new products and services themselves consider disability struggles efficiently.\n"},"eliasProfile":{"content":"\n## Elias Rangel\n\nI am Elias Rangel an independent web developer working in the Johnson and surrounding counties in Texas. I have lived in Texas most of my life and grew up in Fort Worth.\n\nI was home schooled until I went to college at 16 which gave me time to pursue extracurricular activities that were not as normal. I, for example, led a 50 mile canoe trip for the Scouting organization for several years. This included preparing equipment and food, maintaining safety protocols, and arranging all the logistics. Experience being a leader in the Scouting organization and having the responsibility of multiple people gave me invaluable skills in the management and growth of my new business. It has also given me a purpose to remain organized, professional, and efficient at the services I offer.. More than being outside I also had the time to study, independently programming and web development.\n\nI began studying web development as a side project while taking university courses at Texas Christian University. This led me to creating my own blog site with pure HTML, updating the files manually every time I wanted a new blog post. Since then I have learned a lot and transferred to two additional universities: University of Texas at El Paso and University of Texas at Arlington (UTA)\n\nMy transfer to these two universities was caused by major life changes. My wife, Abigail, and I move to El Paso and back again transferring universities both times. While back in Fort Worth Abigail was able to complete her English degree while I worked in the food industry. I recently quit the food industry to offer my services in consulting independently.\n\nWith my background in Scouting as a leader,I began being an advocate with my wife in the autistic community. I have been high functioning my whole life, but witnessed many failures of educational systems in accommodating disabled people. This lack of support is part of the core statement behind the services I offer. I strive to be flexible, understanding, and appreciative of the effort others put into operating within our business contracts.\n\nI am currently offering my consulting services while working on my undergraduate in computer science.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
