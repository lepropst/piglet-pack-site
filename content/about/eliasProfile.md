## Elias Rangel

I am Elias Rangel an independent web developer working in the Johnson and surrounding counties in Texas. I have lived in Texas most of my life and grew up in Fort Worth.

I was home schooled until I went to college at 16 which gave me time to pursue extracurricular activities that were not as normal. I, for example, led a 50 mile canoe trip for the Scouting organization for several years. This included preparing equipment and food, maintaining safety protocols, and arranging all the logistics. Experience being a leader in the Scouting organization and having the responsibility of multiple people gave me invaluable skills in the management and growth of my new business. It has also given me a purpose to remain organized, professional, and efficient at the services I offer.. More than being outside I also had the time to study, independently programming and web development.

I began studying web development as a side project while taking university courses at Texas Christian University. This led me to creating my own blog site with pure HTML, updating the files manually every time I wanted a new blog post. Since then I have learned a lot and transferred to two additional universities: University of Texas at El Paso and University of Texas at Arlington (UTA)

My transfer to these two universities was caused by major life changes. My wife, Abigail, and I move to El Paso and back again transferring universities both times. While back in Fort Worth Abigail was able to complete her English degree while I worked in the food industry. I recently quit the food industry to offer my services in consulting independently.

With my background in Scouting as a leader,I began being an advocate with my wife in the autistic community. I have been high functioning my whole life, but witnessed many failures of educational systems in accommodating disabled people. This lack of support is part of the core statement behind the services I offer. I strive to be flexible, understanding, and appreciative of the effort others put into operating within our business contracts.

I am currently offering my consulting services while working on my undergraduate in computer science.
