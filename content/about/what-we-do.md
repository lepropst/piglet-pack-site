## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our core mission to remain accessible and flexible, we can do anything. Our staff has numerous years of full stack development education and has stayed up to date with the use of microservices and cloud computing services to accomplish a wide variety of tasks. From backend server development in Python, NodeJs, and SQL, to frontend development with and without frameworks, or services are highly extensible.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content management solutions (CMS) such as Shopify, Wordpresss, Wix, or Foursquare can be difficult to manage or require work that takes extra time. Further, hosting services, content delivery networks, or other online services can provide a hassle that is not necessary when only wanting to focus on content creation and a working website or delivery feed.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can provide services that simplify the steps of maintaining any sort of online presence. From the above-mentioned services, to creating a custom server, or setting up a self-hosted CMS we can provide a service plan with recommendations and complete transparency on best practices and our plan of work.
