## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asking “why do we do it?” we remember that we are not only supporting ourselves, but that our work allows us to spread better practices for accessibility on the web and provide such an outward image that we can encourage inclusive and thoughtful business practices in any interaction.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piglet Pack was created out of the effort of autistic individuals to remain conscious and transparent in our business practices. We strive to provide services that allow us to initiate positive experiences between digital presences and inclusive audiences.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our work within the online disability community and locally has shown us that there are many disconnects between digital services and client interests. Development practices, technology stacks, or stubborn hosting services often provide complex systems to work with when managing an online presence. Even registering for API services, content management systems, or blogging platforms require additional work that results in overlooked perspectives in the creation of content.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main purpose, why we do it, is to make your digital services simple because everyone deserves accessible data. Everyone deserves to manage their online image the way the want with the technology they desire. At the core of any of our services lies a guarantee to help our clients navigate complex situations regarding digital services and provide insight regardless of the monetary outcome of Piglet Pack.
