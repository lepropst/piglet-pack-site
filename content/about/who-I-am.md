## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a computer science student studying at Regis University. I have pursued my computer science degree while offering web development services in an effort to support myself while attending college. My hobbies include software development, climbing, and fishing which have all had a profound impact on how I study and go about building my professional career. Each hobby has had an impact in my motivation to continue pursuing a professional career within computer science.

#### I am also an Eagle Scout and have been a part of the scouting organization for a while. I served as a summer camp staff, and later as a high adventure director for a 50-mile canoe trip. This has taught me many skills from organizational to functional and practical ones that continue to serve me.
