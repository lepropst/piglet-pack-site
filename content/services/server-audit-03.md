Piglet Pack has the capability to break down complex situations
regarding digital services into actionable chunks to efficiently
resolve issues from billing, configuration, API updates, or versioning
errors. Whether our clients are well versed or not, they often rely on
us to generate succinct reports on the status of digital services when
unexpected behavior appears.

Breaking or not, unexpected behavior from billing issues to content
delivery issues, can impact the performance of a clientâ€™s digital
presence. Our digital service audits provide insight to the status and
expected performance of various digital assets so that our clients can
rest assured their services remain working. Simple audits can provide
key insight to the workings, practices used, and current status of
search engine ranking for a clients website. Further analysis can
reveal security vulnerabilitiies and non cost-effective areas. Our
fully detailed reports provide these insights in an effort to promote
the best practices for our clients.
