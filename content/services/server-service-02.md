Our custom server creation service offers a wide variety of technology stacks to build any type of custom server. Application programming interfaces (API) and business critical services, to gaming servers all fall within the realm of possibility with this service.

The pricing model for this service varies as it is wholly dependent upon client needs in regards to the server configuration and type of server. The $300 mark would be equivalent to setting up a MineCraft or static site server with appropriate protocols in place to protect it and our clients.

Hosting options are listed below for both Piglet Pack managed and client managed solutions.
