AWS, Google Cloud Products, and Cloudflare networks can be complex to
manage. Piglet pack can host, manage, and completely construct new web
services with serverless infrastructure according to client wants.

From independent functions for small workflows, to fully distributed
delivery systems, mailing systems, or other business software needs
Piglet Pack has the necessary experience to design and implement
serverless architectures. Our services can be full-fledged management

with notifications of due charges and renewals or can be simple
designs and help with implementations. Completely up to the client our
services mimic the model that many cloud service providers adhere to.
