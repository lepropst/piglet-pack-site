We can perform an audit of your website to determine several factors:

<div style="display:flex;flexDirection:column">
security standards
accessibility standards
performance metrics
</div>

These are important and can lead to huge improvements for your clients experience. Our website audit provides the tools to create an actionable plan towards any issue.

We can also cover audits of websites that are not working. We consider this more of an investigation but are able to determine many cases of failure.

Our detailed reports provide these insights in an effort to promote the best practices for our clients.
