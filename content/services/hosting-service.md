#### Self Hosted Options

Most self hosted options are more work, but significantly cut down costs as you provide the space, technology, and internet connection.

We can help you get set up self hosting whether thats a MineCraft server, or a full blown web application. This options, while technically more complex is great if you want to host a gaming server for friends, maintain your own blog at home, or even create your own TODO app.

Our go to strategy is to set up NGINX as a proxy and to secure endpoints for your servers. This protects your server and home connections and prepares you for future projects.
