<h2 style="animation: fadeIn 5s; border-bottom:1px solid black;">Hosting services</h2>

Our server and hosting services provide easy and cost-effective solutions for launching your site or web service. Detailed plans put all the power with our clients about what to do and the amount they spend. We operate as a middle person between the confusing architecture that hosting providers offer and clients who want simple solutions.
We have experience with the following languages and are able to provide solutions within those realms:

- Python
- NodeJs
- Typescript
- Dart
